    <h1>Hello everyone this is my GWDS project</h1>
    <h2>my website consists of 4 parts</h2>
    <h3>The first part is the typographic systems, which 
        are 8 typographic systems that are each invdidually unique: </h3>
        <h4>This is the axial typographic system which is basically when 
            information is displayed on the right side or the left side or both of an axis </h4>
        <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/axial typo.png"></p>

        <h5>This is the Bilateral typographic system which is basically when the text
            is displayed in symetricall way on one axis  </h5>
        <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/Bilateral typo.png"></p>
        
        <h6>This is the Dilational typographic system which is basically when text 
            expands froma centre point in a circular way </h6>
        <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/dilational typo.png"></p>
       
        <h7>This is the Grid typographic system which is basically when text is divided
            into sections and oragized fashion.</h7>
            <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/Grid typo.png"></p>
       
            <h8>This is the Modular typographic system which is basically when text
            is organized in a repetitive fashion.</h8>
            <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/modular typo.png"></p>
           
            <h9>This is the radial typographic system which is basically when text 
            is organized from a centre point in a sunray fashion</h9>
            <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/radial typo.png"></p>

            <h10>This is the random typographic system which is basically when text
                is oragnized in a random fashion</h10>
                <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/Random typo.png"></p>
<h11>This is the Transitional typographic system  which is basically when text
    is organized in a wavy pattern.</h11>
    <p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/Transitional typo.png"></p>
<h12>The second part is the poster,which is advertising a skating event for girls </h12>
<p> <img class="Typo-item" src="./images/GWDS poster .png"></p>
<h13>The third part are the coding work sheets that aided the creation of this 
    website , Which consists of 5 worksheets (some may be interelated) </h13>
    <h14> <a href="./index copy.html">Coding worksheet 1</a></h14>
    <h14> <a href="./index copy 2.html">Coding worksheet 2</a></h14>
    <h14> <a href="./index copy 3.html">Coding worksheet 3</a></h14>
    <h14> <a href="./cake.html">Coding worksheet 4</a></h14>
    <h14> <a href="./button.html">Coding worksheet 5</a></h14>
    
    
    <h15> 
        And lastly here is the reflection essay explaining in detail 
        the processes that took place for the creation of this webiste :
    </h15>
    <p1>This project was full of several obstacles and challenges , 
        as it consisted of many separate individual projects that each have their own  challenges and concepts , 
      and then are all put together in order to create a website. The poster took sometime to create as It was
        essential to be very creative on finding the right theme and design that is appropriate for the picture that has been  chosen .
        An important decision was taken to change the color of the picture chosen in order to make it look more interesting and eye catching for the audience.
        Then the creativity led to adding a few stamps that are related to the posters theme and what it is about.
        As for the typography systems it took days to complete as it was more than essential to find a creative way to fit the information given in way that is
        similar for each of the 8 typographic systems, after a thorough research it was easily applicable to add the concept of each of the 8 typographic systems , 
        yet they all shared one thing in common and that was making sure that the essential information in the text provided was easily readable and catches the eye of
        the audience to ensure that they are aware of the important information in the text. Next, there are coding worksheets  which consisted of 5 coding worksheets ,
        each work sheet aided the process of learning the fundamentals of creating an appropriate website that can easily hold all the projects and at the same time can
         be presented in a way that allows the audience to view it without facing any difficulties or  challenges although they took some time to complete they played a critical role
          in finishing this project with the best quality possible . As for this reflection essay which is also a big part of this project this was created to explain in full detail and 
        step by step how this project was fulfilled and how it met all the requirements needed  . And last but not least the website itself which groups all the individual projects into one showcase ,
        this website took several days to complete as it required a vast amount of coding in order to present the information inside in the best way possible , fortunately using the coding worksheets provided
         the needed information for the essential ingredients of a basic website and with a few extra creative touches the website was ready to be presented to the audience in the best quality possible ensuring 
         its easy navigation and readability and ability to high light the essential information that was intended to reach the audience .</p1>
